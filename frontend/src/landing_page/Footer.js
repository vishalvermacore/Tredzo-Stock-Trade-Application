            Attention investors: 1. Stock brokers can accept securities as
            margins from clients only by way of pledge in the depository system
            w.e.f September 01, 2020. 2. Update your e-mail and phone number
            with your stock broker / depository participant and receive OTP
            directly from depository on your e-mail and/or mobile number to
            create pledge. 3. Check your securities / MF / bonds in the
            consolidated account statement issued by NSDL/CDSL every month.

            India's largest broker based on networth as per NSE. NSE broker
            factsheet "Prevent unauthorised transactions in your account. Update
            your mobile numbers/email IDs with your stock brokers. Receive
            information of your transactions directly from Exchange on your
            mobile/email at the end of the day. Issued in the interest of
            investors. KYC is one time exercise while dealing in securities
            markets - once KYC is done through a SEBI registered intermediary
            (broker, DP, Mutual Fund etc.), you need not undergo the same
            process again when you approach another intermediary." Dear
            Investor, if you are subscribing to an IPO, there is no need to
            issue a cheque. Please write the Bank account number and sign the
            IPO application form to authorize your bank to make payment in case
            of allotment. In case of non allotment the funds will remain in your
            bank account. As a business we don't give stock tips, and have not
            authorized anyone to trade on behalf of others. If you find anyone
            claiming to be part of Zerodha and offering such services, please
